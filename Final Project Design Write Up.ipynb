    "This project will use a set of Jeopardy questions to determine which types of questions are the most common and the most valuable. The Reddit dataset includes 216,930 questions from 1984 to 2012. I will be looking at frequency of keywords in questions and answers and clustering them into larger categories that will be used to determine which categories are the most common and the most frequent. I believe that the way in which the categories are determined will be the most impactful on understanding which categories are the most common and most valuable (in terms of $$). I predict that US History and Geography would be the most common and most valuable categories."

I found this video: https://vimeo.com/29001512 that was Jeopardy contestant, Roger Craig, talking about \"Knowledge Tracking\" and how he used techniques such as clustering, to track his progress in preparation for his appearance on Jeopardy. While I do not plan to track my knowledge, I do hope to conduct an exploratory analysis into the dataset similar to Craig's first portion of his project. The dataset comes with a \"Category\" column, which I will not be using in my categorization of the data because I would like to come up with slightly broader categories."

I am wondering how much information I will have to pass into my algorithm for it to understand what to group together. I am also wondering if it is better to cluster based on the questions or the answers. I am limited by the data only being through 2006, meaning that it doesn't capture more recent questions which I feel would be more telling as to what someone could expect now. I would also have liked to have whether or not the question was answered correctly on the show. I could've used this to see if any categories were more challenging than others. The dataset is also from Reddit- reviews suggested it was clean, but it is possible that there may be errors within the data which I will have to clean."
